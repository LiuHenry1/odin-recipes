The Odin Project: [Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

The first project in The Odin Project curriculum. This project covered basic HTML topics: boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, both ordered and unordered lists, links, and images. This was also good practice for learning how to utilize the workflow of git and writing helpful commit messages.
